* Tree paths will potontially be able to be used with mkdirp to build the filestructure
* Tree file contents will include: 
  * name 
  * path
  * type
  * children: [array of SHA1 hashes] !note: they will need to be sorted for consistency

  format will be an array: so that indices are guaranteed to be in the same order: 
  [
    ['TYPE'],
    ['NAME'],
    ['PATH'],
    ['CHILD1HASH', ['CHILD2HASH'] ... ]
  ]

  when generating hashes recursively in the index, this format must be strictly followed.
